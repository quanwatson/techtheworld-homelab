# Security

This lab is built with a **security-first** approach.

## Scope
- This repository contains documentation and sanitized config references.
- **Do not store secrets** here (API keys, private keys, passwords, tokens).

## Principles
- Least privilege (RBAC)
- Segmentation (VLANs, zones)
- Secure remote access (VPN, bastion)
- Logging + monitoring
- Backups with restore testing

# Security Notice

This repository is intended for educational and documentation purposes only.

- No real credentials, API keys, or secrets are stored
- All passwords and tokens are placeholders or redacted
- Administrative access is performed via private networks only
- Public services are exposed using secure tunneling methods

Examples are illustrative and non-functional by design.
