# Goals

## Primary Objective

The primary goal of this HomeLab is to develop **real-world engineering capability**, not just familiarity with tools.

This includes:
- Designing systems before deploying them
- Understanding failure modes and recovery paths
- Applying security and segmentation intentionally
- Documenting work in a way others can follow

---

## Technical Skill Goals

This lab is structured to build and reinforce skills across the following domains:

### Networking
- Layer 2 and Layer 3 design and enforcement
- VLAN segmentation and trunking
- Firewall policy design and validation
- Switch hardening and loop prevention
- Failure isolation and recovery

### Systems & Virtualization
- Hypervisor deployment and hardening
- VM separation of duties
- Resource planning under constraint
- Backup and recovery strategy
- Platform lifecycle awareness

### Identity & Trust
- Internal DNS design
- Certificate authority concepts
- Service-to-service trust
- Identity boundaries and access models

### Operations & Reliability
- Change control discipline
- Phase-gated execution
- Rollback planning
- Validation evidence
- Incident-style learning

---

## Documentation & Process Goals

Equally important to the technical outcomes are **process and communication goals**:

- Treat documentation as part of the system
- Maintain a clean, reviewable repository
- Separate intent, execution, and reflection
- Produce artifacts suitable for audits and handoff
- Build habits that scale to teams and enterprises

---

## Career Development Goals

This HomeLab supports my progression from:
**IT Support → Network / Systems Engineering → Solutions Architecture**

By the time this project matures, it should clearly demonstrate:
- Readiness for higher-responsibility roles
- Comfort operating across multiple layers of infrastructure
- Ability to reason about design trade-offs
- A disciplined, professional engineering mindset

---

## Non-Goals (Intentional Exclusions)

To maintain focus, this HomeLab intentionally avoids:
- Tool sprawl without purpose
- Undocumented experimentation
- “Magic” automation without understanding
- Optimizing for speed at the expense of clarity
- Treating AI or tooling as substitutes for judgment

---

## Summary

Every goal in this lab serves one outcome:

> **Become a reliable engineer who can design, implement, secure, and explain systems with confidence.**

Everything else is secondary.
