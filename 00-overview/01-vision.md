# Vision

## Long-Term Intent

This HomeLab exists to support my transition from **IT Support / Operations** into **Network Engineering and Solutions Architecture**, with an emphasis on **design judgment, operational discipline, and system thinking**.

The vision is not to build the largest lab or chase tools for their own sake, but to cultivate the ability to:
- Design systems intentionally
- Reason about trade-offs and constraints
- Execute changes safely
- Recover from failure confidently
- Communicate decisions clearly through documentation

---

## Professional Orientation

This lab is modeled after how infrastructure is approached in **real organizations**, not how labs are typically built for experimentation alone.

Key characteristics of the vision:
- Documentation precedes implementation
- Changes are phase-gated and reversible
- Stability is prioritized over novelty
- Constraints are embraced as training surfaces
- Every decision has an articulated rationale

The lab is treated as a **living system**, not a sandbox.

---

## Career Alignment

This HomeLab directly supports my career progression toward roles such as:
- Network Engineer
- Systems Engineer
- Solutions Architect
- MSP / Enterprise Infrastructure Engineer

The focus is on **transferable thinking**, not vendor-specific memorization.

Each phase is designed to answer questions an employer or architect must routinely face:
- Why was this designed this way?
- What risks were considered?
- How would this scale?
- How would this fail?
- How would this be operated by someone else?

---

## What Success Looks Like

This HomeLab is successful if it:
- Produces artifacts that stand up to professional scrutiny
- Demonstrates sound judgment under constraint
- Shows growth over time through logs and iteration
- Can be explained clearly to a technical reviewer
- Translates directly into real-world engineering confidence

The end goal is not the lab itself —  
the goal is **engineering maturity**.
